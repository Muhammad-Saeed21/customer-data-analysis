# 📊 Customer Data Analysis Using Python (Colab Notebook)

This project is a complete exploratory data analysis (EDA) performed in **Google Colab** using a dataset of 1,000 customers.  
I created this project as personal practice to improve my skills in **Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib**, and overall data analysis workflow — and to showcase my work to potential clients.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The notebook performs full end-to-end data analysis on the file **customers-1000.csv**, including:

- Loading & inspecting the dataset  
- Data cleaning (handling missing values, dropping NULL rows)  
- Extracting year & month from subscription dates  
- Country-wise & city-wise customer distribution  
- Trend analysis using line charts  
- Email domain analysis  
- Visualizations using Seaborn & Matplotlib  

Every cell includes clear comments for understanding.

## 📚 Analysis Performed

### ✔️ 1. Data Loading & Inspection  
- Display first rows  
- View shape, columns, missing values  
- Summary statistics

### ✔️ 2. Data Cleaning  
- Dropping blank rows  
- Filling missing phone numbers with `"Not Available"`  

### ✔️ 3. Feature Engineering  
- Converted *Subscription Date* to datetime  
- Extracted **Year** and **Month**

### ✔️ 4. Exploratory Data Analysis  
- Top countries by customer count  
- Top cities by customer count  
- Subscription trend per year  
- Email domain frequency  

### ✔️ 5. Visualizations  
- Bar charts (Top countries, cities, email domains)  
- Line chart (Year-wise trend)  
- Consistent formatting with Seaborn theme
